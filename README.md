# Haii, I'm Ville

Been programming since 2022-01-15 and uh it's been fun.  
Programming has always been a side-hobby kind-of thing, so i make stuff i find fun and sometimes silly.  
I'd love to call myself a "Fullstack Developer" but you know, imposter syndrome!

This is a "temporary" readme until i've overcome my 582 dumped uncompleted side-projects  
and can finally make a clean website for my portfolio :)

> What will today's adventure be?

## Projects

- **Pixel Display | [Visit the website here!](https://display.stamsite.nu)**  
      A website similar to Reddit's r/place event.  
      Custom-built to fit one of my content creator friends.  
      Includes many features that integrate with Twitch, Discord,  
      Statistics, Timelapses, Mod tools & Use of Websockets,    
      And oh! Over 2000+ Registered users and over 1 Million pixels placed.  
      Built With SvelteKit, Bun Backend & SQLite.  
- **Toolbox | [Visit the repository here!](https://github.com/VilleOlof/Toolbox)**  
      A Davinci Resolve 18 Workflow Integration that uses a modular drag-n-drop system  
      where the user is always in-control of the layout and what modules exist within it.  
      Users can create their own modules or use the existing built-in ones to ease their  
      workflow in editing. Built-in APIs to easier sync and save data & settings.  
      Built with Svelte + Electron.  
- **90gQ Statistik | [Visit the website here!](https://stats.90gq.se/q)**  
      A website built to view and easily search Minecraft Statistics on an entire server.  
      View every single known statistic in the game, you can filter the "leaderboards",  
      See other peoples profiles and graphs, timelines of their Advancements and more.  
      Built with SvelteKit + SQLite
- **Vylet Ponlde | [Visit the website here!](https://vyletponlde.lifelike.dev)**  
      A wordle-esque game where everyday you get 5 new random songs with 3 clues on each.  
      And use the clues to figure out exactly which song it is from the artist 'Vylet Pony'.  
      And then share your score without spoiling the songs, and  
      it has an archive so you can play previous days!  
- **90gQ Puls | [Visit the website here!](https://puls.olofspelar.se)**  
      An online store (without payment functionality), for A Minecraft server.  
      Search and filter items, see reviews, compare prices.  
      View peoples shops, manage the items and their stock  
- **My Little Guessy**  
      A website similar to GeoGuessr but for the show My Little Pony.  
      You get a random frame from any season, any episode at any timestamp-  
      And if you guess the Season & Episode correct you gain a point.  
      Multi-languag support, detailed options. Audio mode.  
      Frames are generated on the fly on the server with FFmpeg and pre-cached on client.  
      Also includes a fuzzy search system where you can type an episode title or description  
      and automatically find the correct season and episode numbers.  
      Built with SvelteKit, Bun Backend (w/ Elysia), SQLite for metadata, FFmpeg.
